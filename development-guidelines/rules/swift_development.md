# Swift Development Rules

Follow the coding standards in `./development-guidelines/rules/coding_rules.md`.

## Mandatory

- No force unwraps, no `try!`, no force casts
- Guard clauses for validation, early returns over nesting
- Division safety: check for zero before dividing
- Swift 6 strict concurrency compliance
- All public APIs need DocC comments (see `./development-guidelines/rules/docc_guidelines.md`)

## Testing (TDD)

Follow `./development-guidelines/rules/test_driven_development.md`:
- Write failing tests BEFORE implementation
- Test golden path, edge cases, invalid inputs
- Use deterministic test data (no random values)
- Floating point: use accuracy-based assertions, not exact equality
